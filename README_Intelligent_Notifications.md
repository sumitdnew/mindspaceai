## üîÑ Adaptive Timing System

### Learning Algorithm

The system learns optimal notification times through:

1. **Completion Pattern Analysis**: Identifies hours with highest completion rates
2. **Busy Period Detection**: Finds times when patients typically miss exercises
3. **Engagement Correlation**: Links notification timing to exercise completion
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Adjusts timing based on recent patterns

### Timing Windows

- **Morning** (8-10 AM): 30% weight - Quick mood check-ins
- **Midday** (12-2 PM): 20% weight - Micro-moment assessments
- **Evening** (6-8 PM): 40% weight - Activity completion review
- **Flexible** (9 AM-9 PM): 10% weight - Adaptive timing

### Constraints

- **Quiet Hours**: 10 PM - 8 AM (no notifications unless escalation)
- **Minimum Interval**: 30 minutes between notifications
- **Daily Limit**: Maximum 5 notifications per day
- **Busy Period Buffer**: 2-hour buffer around identified busy times

## üö® Escalation Protocols

### Escalation Levels

| Level | Days Missed | Tone | Frequency | Provider Alert |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|----------------|
| Gentle | 1 | Supportive | Normal | No |
| Concerned | 2 | Caring | Increased | No |
| Urgent | 3 | Urgent | High | Yes |
| Crisis | 5+ | Emergency | Immediate | Yes + Emergency |

### Provider Alert Triggers

1. **High Risk Patients**: PHQ-9 score ‚â• 15 (moderately severe or worse)
2. **Activity Gap**: 3+ days without exercise completion
3. **Mood Decline**: Significant mood deterioration detected
4. **Crisis Indicators**: 5+ days missed or suicidal ideation

### Emergency Contact Activation

- **Crisis Situations**: Immediate provider contact required
- **High-Risk Patients**: Enhanced monitoring and alerts
- **Mood Deterioration**: Automatic escalation for significant declines
- **Activity Gaps**: Progressive escalation based on missed days
