- **`/provider/crisis_detection/batch_assess_all`** (POST): Batch assess all patients

### 3. PHQ-9 Assessment Integration
- **Real-time Analysis**: ML crisis detection runs automatically on PHQ-9 submission
- **Risk Assessment**: Combines traditional PHQ-9 analysis with ML predictions
- **Alert Generation**: Creates crisis alerts for high-risk ML predictions
- **Data Enhancement**: Adds ML risk data to assessment results

### 4. Provider Dashboard Integration
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: Added ML crisis alerts to provider dashboard
- **Management Interface**: Dedicated crisis detection management page
- **Model Status**: Real-time model training status and statistics
- **Batch Operations**: Tools for batch risk assessment

### 5. Data Preparation Utilities
- **Patient Data Preparation**: Converts database records to ML model features
- **Training Data Generation**: Prepares training data from historical assessments
- **Feature Engineering**: 19+ features including PHQ-9 scores, mood trends, exercise data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for missing data

### 6. User Interface
- **Crisis Detection Management Page**: Complete UI for managing ML crisis detection
- **Alert Visualization**: Color-coded alerts by severity level
- **Model Controls**: Train model and batch assessment buttons
- **Real-time Updates**: Live model status and statistics

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Model Features (19 total)
- **PHQ-9 Features**: Total score, Q9 score, severity level, trend
- **Mood Features**: Intensity, trend, low mood indicators
- **Exercise Features**: Completion rate, drop indicators
- **Temporal Features**: Days since last session, assessment frequency
- **Risk Features**: Crisis keyword count, previous crisis history
- **Demographic Features**: Age, treatment duration, social support

### Risk Levels
- **CRITICAL**: ≥80% probability (immediate intervention)
- **HIGH**: 60-79% probability (urgent attention)
- **MEDIUM**: 40-59% probability (increased monitoring)
- **LOW**: 20-39% probability (routine care)
- **MINIMAL**: <20% probability (standard monitoring)

### Alert Types
- **`ml_crisis_detection`**: Individual patient assessment alerts
- **`ml_crisis_detection_batch`**: Batch assessment alerts
- **`high_risk_phq9`**: Traditional PHQ-9 high-risk alerts

## 📊 Test Results

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Providers
1. **Start the app**: `python start_ai_app.py`
2. **Login**: Use `provider1` / `password123`
3. **Access Crisis Detection**: Navigate to `/provider/crisis_detection`
4. **Train Model**: Click "Train Model" to train with current data
5. **Batch Assess**: Click "Assess All Patients" for comprehensive risk assessment

### For Patients
- Crisis detection runs automatically on PHQ-9 assessment submission
- ML risk assessment is included in assessment results
- High-risk predictions trigger automatic crisis alerts

### API Usage
```python
# Assess individual patient risk
POST /api/crisis_detection/assess_risk
{
    "patient_id": 123
}

# Batch assess multiple patients
POST /api/crisis_detection/batch_assess
{
    "patient_ids": [123, 124, 125]
}

# Train model with current data
POST /api/crisis_detection/train_model

# Get model status
GET /api/crisis_detection/model_status
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require user authentication
- **Role-based Access**: Provider-only access to management functions
- **Data Privacy**: Patient data processed securely within the application
- **Audit Trail**: All crisis alerts logged with timestamps and user information

## 📈 Benefits
1. **Early Detection**: Identifies crisis risk before traditional PHQ-9 thresholds
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Uses multiple data sources beyond PHQ-9 scores
3. **Automated Alerts**: Reduces manual monitoring burden on providers
4. **Scalable**: Can assess hundreds of patients simultaneously
5. **Adaptive**: Model can be retrained with new data
6. **Integrated**: Seamlessly integrated into existing workflow

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous risk assessment beyond assessments
- **Predictive Analytics**: Trend analysis and risk trajectory prediction
- **Custom Thresholds**: Provider-configurable risk thresholds
- **Advanced Features**: Integration with additional data sources
- **Mobile Alerts**: Push notifications for critical alerts
